# Front-End Framework

*Please note that this is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS and is NOT stable.*.

Some SASS and TypeScript code that I extracted from some of the websites that I have built.

## Getting Started

Run bundler (`bundle`). Run npm (`npm install`). Run tests with `bundle exec rake blade:runner`

Requires having a working Node.js and Ruby development environment available.
