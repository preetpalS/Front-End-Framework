# Front-End Framework

*Please note that this is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS and is NOT stable.*

Some SASS and TypeScript code that I extracted from some of the websites that I have built.

Intended to work with all modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, FireFox, IE (IE11), Opera, Safari).

## Installation

Installing using NPM or Yarn.

*Usage instructions will become available as library becomes more stable.*

## Getting Started (Development)

Requires having a working Node.js development environment available.

Note that if you are using the TypeScript `--outFile` which concatenates and emits output to a single file, do not require framework components individually (require
`framework/all` only). If you want to require framework components individually (assuming that you are not using the TypeScript `--outFile` option), explicitly look
at the references in the source file for the specific component.
